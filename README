This is a simple little program that make the <strong>Blizzard Warcraft III</strong> to fit your current screen resolution. Will you can do this by using the <em>regedit</em> yourself to modify "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Blizzard Entertainment\Warcraft III\Video\" this but this tool is much easier.

The program is in Chinese and I don't want to change it but you can still pretty easy to use it since you only need to push one button(with the [确定更改] sign) once.
